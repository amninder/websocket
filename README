1.  port number for websocket to listen is defined in line 26 of ws.py
2.  run
  a. 'python ws.py' or
  b. "twistd -y ws.py"
      this option will generate two files
        (i).  "twistd.log". This file will keep the track of the log for the twisted websocket.
        (ii). "twistd.pid". This file will store the PID of the twistd process which can be used to kill the process by "kill -INT <PID number>".
  c. I am using python-foreman, so you can run 'foreman start'.
